Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .
